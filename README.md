# Hey bro!
Thanks for reading. I made for u some challange beacuse i want to learn you something.

**PROGRAM THAT NEED THE LICENSE KEY IS NAMED:** "that license shit.exe" or "that_license_shit.exe"

**PROGRAM THAT CRACK THE KEYS IS NAMED:** "cracker.bat"

> I changed the output file where keys are saved so its not "%temp%\encrypted.dll" it can be "%appdata%\secret.file" or anywhere else
your quest is find where is the keys saved and edit the "cracker.bat" to working!

> If u watched the first part of my tutorial maybe you heard about getting a source code from converted batch file to .exe (this method work for all convertors).

> Maybe if you will solve the challange you will be happy and proud of you.

**GOOD LUCK!**
